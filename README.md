**OVERVIEW**

1. The client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?

2. The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.
Here is a brief overview of the dataset:
• Number of observations: 11,159
• Number of variables: 16
• File type: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

3. The variables in the dataset are:
• Make: the make or brand of the car
• Model: the specific model of the car
• Year: the year the car was released
• Engine Fuel Type: the type of fuel used by the car (gasoline, diesel, etc.)
• Engine HP: the horsepower of the car's engine
• Engine Cylinders: the number of cylinders in the car's engine
• Transmission Type: the type of transmission (automatic or manual)
• Driven Wheels: the type of wheels driven by the car (front, rear, all)
• Number of Doors: the number of doors the car has
• Market Category: the market category the car belongs to (Luxury, Performance, 
etc.)
• Vehicle Size: the size of the car
• Vehicle Style: the style of the car (Sedan, Coupe, etc.)
• Highway MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets on the highway
• City MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets in the city
• Popularity: a ranking of the popularity of the car (based on the number of times it has 
been viewed on Edmunds.com)
• MSRP: the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the car
